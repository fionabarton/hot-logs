Unity scripts for a 16-Bit style 2D RPG prototype

After working my way through a series of guided tutorials, this ongoing pet project was initially started in 2018 with the aim of creating a 2D role-playing game 
inspired by classic series from the 8 and 16-bit home video game console eras such as Dragon Quest, Mother, The Legend of Zelda, etc.
